# CSR for Education: Transforming Learning Landscapes in India

## Introduction

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a game-changer in India's education sector, bridging the gap between corporate profitability and societal development. With mandatory CSR spending under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013, companies are increasingly investing in education initiatives that create lasting impact. Naaz Commercial Institute, operating in rural Bihar, has benefited immensely from such partnerships, expanding its reach and effectiveness.
