# Child Marriage in India: Causes, Consequences, and Prevention Efforts

Child marriage remains a significant challenge in India, particularly affecting girls and perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality. Naaz Commercial Institute actively works to prevent child marriage through education, advocacy, and community engagement in rural Bihar.
