Section 80G of the Income-tax Act, 1961, is one of the most significant provisions in India's tax law that encourages philanthropy by allowing taxpayers to claim deductions on donations made to charitable organizations. This section has been instrumental in mobilizing private resources for social welfare activities, including education, health, and poverty alleviation. In this comprehensive guide, we delve deep into the intricacies of Section 80G, its history, eligibility criteria, deduction mechanisms, and its impact on NGOs like Naaz Commercial Institute.

### Historical Background

Introduced in the Income-tax Act, 1961, Section 80G was designed to promote charitable giving by providing tax incentives. The provision recognizes that charitable activities are essential for societal development and that the government alone cannot address all social issues. By offering deductions, the government aims to involve citizens and corporations in nation-building efforts.

Over the years, Section 80G has undergone several amendments to make it more effective and to prevent misuse. For instance, the Finance Act, 2003, introduced stricter approval processes, and recent amendments have linked it with Aadhaar for better compliance.

### Eligibility for Donors

Any taxpayer, whether an individual, Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), firm, company, or association, can claim deductions under Section 80G. The key requirement is that the donation must be made to an institution approved under Section 80G. The donor must ensure that the NGO is genuine and has the necessary approvals.

Donations can be made in cash or kind, but for cash donations exceeding ₹2,000, the donor's PAN is mandatory. Kind donations, such as books or equipment, are valued at fair market value.

### Eligibility for NGOs

For an NGO to be eligible for Section 80G approval, it must:

1. Be registered under Section 12A or 12AA of the Income-tax Act.

2. Engage in activities that qualify as charitable under Section 2(15), such as relief of the poor, education, medical relief, or preservation of environment.

3. Not have any income that is not exempt under Section 11 or 12.

4. Maintain proper books of accounts and submit annual returns.

Naaz Commercial Institute, operating in rural Bihar, is approved under Section 80G, allowing donors to claim benefits for contributions towards its education and skill development programs.

### Types of Deductions

Section 80G provides two main categories of deductions:

- **100% Deduction Without Qualification**: Applicable to donations to funds like the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund, Chief Minister's Relief Fund, National Children's Fund, etc. The entire donated amount is deductible without any upper limit.

- **50% Deduction Subject to Limit**: For donations to other approved institutions, 50% of the donated amount is deductible, but the total deduction cannot exceed 10% of the donor's adjusted gross total income. Adjusted gross total income is the total income minus long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains under Section 111A, and income under Section 115AD or 115D.

For example, if a person's adjusted gross total income is ₹8 lakh, the maximum deduction under this category is ₹40,000 (10% of ₹8 lakh). If they donate ₹1 lakh, they can claim ₹40,000.

Additionally, there are provisions for 100% deduction with qualification for certain institutions, but these are rare.

### Calculation of Deduction

The deduction is calculated as follows:

- For 100% deduction: Donation Amount × 100%

- For 50% deduction: Min(Donation Amount × 50%, 10% of Adjusted Gross Total Income)

It's important to note that the deduction is available only if the donation is made out of income chargeable to tax. Also, donations to political parties or for illegal activities do not qualify.

### Process for Claiming Deduction

1. **Obtain Receipt**: At the time of donation, get a receipt from the NGO. The receipt must include the donor's name, address, PAN, amount donated, mode of payment, and the NGO's 80G approval number.

2. **File Income Tax Return**: Declare the donation in the ITR form under the appropriate schedule. For individuals, it's Schedule 80G.

3. **Verification**: The Income-tax Department may verify the donation, so keep records for at least 6 years.

4. **Online Donations**: With the rise of digital platforms, donations via net banking or UPI are common. Ensure the NGO provides an e-receipt.

### Impact on NGOs and Society

Section 80G has significantly boosted the NGO sector in India. It allows organizations like Naaz Commercial Institute to raise funds for programs that might otherwise lack resources. In rural areas, where government reach is limited, NGOs play a crucial role in education and health.

For instance, Naaz Commercial Institute uses donations to provide Urdu diploma courses, vocational training, and health awareness programs. Tax benefits encourage more people to contribute, leading to broader impact.

On a societal level, this provision supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to education (SDG 4), health (SDG 3), and poverty reduction (SDG 1).

### Challenges and Misuse

Despite its benefits, Section 80G faces challenges:

- **Misuse by Fake NGOs**: Some organizations obtain approvals fraudulently. Donors should verify on the Income-tax Department's website.

- **Capping Issues**: The 10% limit may discourage large donations.

- **Administrative Burden**: NGOs must renew approvals periodically.

The government has responded with measures like mandatory Aadhaar for donors and stricter scrutiny.

### Recent Developments

The Finance Act, 2020, introduced faceless assessments, reducing human interface and improving efficiency. Also, the push for digital India has made claiming deductions easier through online portals.

In the context of COVID-19, donations to relief funds under Section 80G saw a surge, highlighting the provision's relevance in crises.

### Case Study: Naaz Commercial Institute

Naaz Commercial Institute, established in 1990, has been a beneficiary of Section 80G. Donations have enabled it to train over 1,000 students, empower women, and reach multiple villages. A donor contributing ₹20,000 can save ₹10,000 in taxes, while the NGO uses the funds for sustainable development.

### Future of Section 80G

As India moves towards a more inclusive economy, Section 80G is likely to evolve. Potential changes include higher deduction limits, inclusion of more causes, and integration with CSR under Section 135 of the Companies Act.

In conclusion, Section 80G is a powerful tool for promoting philanthropy. By understanding its nuances, donors can maximize benefits while supporting causes like those championed by Naaz Commercial Institute. Always consult a tax expert and verify NGO credentials to ensure your contributions make a difference.
