# Child Labor in India: Causes, Impacts, and Eradication Strategies

Child labor deprives children of education and exposes them to exploitation, hindering India's development. Naaz Commercial Institute actively combats child labor through prevention, rescue, and rehabilitation programs in rural Bihar.

## Understanding Child Labor

Child labor involves work that deprives children of their childhood, education, and development, often harmful to their physical and mental health.

### Legal Definition

- **Child**: Person below 14 years (as per Child Labour Act)
- **Hazardous Work**: 18 occupations and 65 processes prohibited for children
- **Adolescent**: 14-18 years with regulated employment

### Statistics in India

- 10.1 million child laborers (Census 2011)
- 4.3 million in hazardous work
- Higher prevalence in rural areas and agriculture

## Legal Framework Against Child Labor

India has comprehensive laws prohibiting child labor.

### Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986

Key provisions:

- Prohibits employment of children below 14 in hazardous occupations
- Regulates employment of adolescents (14-18 years)
- Establishes monitoring and enforcement mechanisms
- Provides for rehabilitation of rescued children

### Other Relevant Laws

- **RTE Act, 2009**: Ensures free and compulsory education
- **Minimum Wages Act, 1948**: Protects fair wages for adolescents
- **Factories Act, 1948**: Regulates working conditions

## Causes of Child Labor

Multiple factors drive child labor.

### Socio-Economic Factors

- **Poverty**: Families needing children's income for survival
- **Unemployment**: Adult unemployment forcing children to work
- **Debt Bondage**: Indebted families sending children to work
- **Migration**: Rural-urban migration increasing vulnerability

### Educational Factors

- **Lack of Schools**: Insufficient educational facilities
- **Poor Quality Education**: Ineffective schooling deterring attendance
- **Distance to Schools**: Long travel preventing regular attendance
- **Early Dropout**: Children leaving school for work

### Social and Cultural Factors

- **Caste Discrimination**: Marginalized communities more affected
- **Traditional Practices**: Apprenticeship systems exploiting children
- **Family Expectations**: Children contributing to household income

### Institutional Weaknesses

### Social and Economic Impacts
