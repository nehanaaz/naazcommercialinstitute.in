# No Detention Policy in India: Promoting Holistic Learning Without Fear

## Introduction

The No Detention Policy (NDP) in India represents a paradigm shift in education, emphasizing learning without the fear of failure. Implemented under the Right to Education Act, 2009, this policy aimed to reduce dropout rates and promote stress-free learning. However, its implementation and impact have been subjects of intense debate. Naaz Commercial Institute, working extensively in rural education, has observed both the benefits and challenges of this policy. This comprehensive article explores the evolution, implementation, effects, and future of the No Detention Policy in India.

## Historical Background

### Pre-NDP Era

Traditional education focused on examinations and rote learning, leading to high stress and dropout rates.
