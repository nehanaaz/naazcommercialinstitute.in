# Education Empowers: Transforming Lives in Rural Bihar

In the heart of rural Bihar, where traditional livelihoods often limit opportunities, education emerges as the most powerful catalyst for change. Naaz Commercial Institute, established in 1990, has been at the forefront of this transformation, proving that targeted education can empower individuals to overcome systemic barriers and contribute meaningfully to their communities.

## The Power of Education in Rural Contexts

Education empowerment goes beyond mere literacy; it encompasses skill development, critical thinking, and economic independence. In rural Bihar, where agriculture dominates the economy, commercial education provides practical skills that translate directly into employability and entrepreneurship.

### Breaking the Poverty Cycle

Education serves as a powerful tool to interrupt intergenerational poverty. By equipping youth with marketable skills, we enable them to access better employment opportunities and create sustainable livelihoods.

## Legal Foundations of Education in India

India's commitment to education empowerment is enshrined in various legal frameworks that guide our work at Naaz Commercial Institute.

### Constitutional Provisions

Article 21A of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to education as a fundamental right. This constitutional mandate drives our programs to ensure inclusive access to quality education.

### National Education Policy 2020

The NEP 2020 emphasizes vocational and skill-based education, aligning perfectly with our commercial education focus. It promotes flexible learning pathways that cater to diverse needs, including those of rural students.

### Skill India Mission

Launched in 2015, this initiative aims to train 400 million people by 2022. Naaz Commercial Institute contributes to this national goal by providing industry-relevant skills training.
