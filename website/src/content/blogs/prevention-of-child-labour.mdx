# Prevention of Child Labour: Naaz Commercial Institute's Comprehensive Strategy

Child labour deprives children of education, health, and childhood, perpetuating poverty cycles. In rural Bihar, where economic pressures are high, Naaz Commercial Institute implements prevention programs that combine legal compliance, education, economic support, and community engagement to eliminate child labour.

## Understanding Child Labour in India

Child labour involves work that deprives children of education, health, and development opportunities. In rural India, children often work in agriculture, domestic services, or hazardous industries due to poverty and lack of alternatives.

### Forms of Child Labour

- **Agricultural Work**: Children working on family farms or as laborers
- **Domestic Work**: Employment in households affecting education
- **Hazardous Work**: Dangerous occupations risking health and safety
- **Street Work**: Begging, vending, or other informal employment
- **Industrial Work**: Factory or workshop employment

## Legal Framework Against Child Labour

India has comprehensive legislation to prevent child labour.

### Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016

This act:

- Prohibits employment of children under 14 in any occupation
- Regulates work for adolescents (14-18) in non-hazardous sectors
- Defines hazardous occupations for children
- Provides for rehabilitation and education of child laborers

### Right to Education Act, 2009

RTE supports prevention by:

- Ensuring free compulsory education for all children
- Providing education as an alternative to labour
- Prohibiting discrimination in educational access

### Juvenile Justice Act, 2015

This act addresses child labour through:

- Rehabilitation of children rescued from labour
- Family support and reintegration programs
- Prohibition of child labour in justice system responses

## Naaz Commercial Institute's Prevention Approach

Our multi-faceted strategy addresses root causes and provides alternatives.

### Prevention Programs

- **Education Access**: Ensuring all children have schooling options
- **Awareness Campaigns**: Educating families about child labour harms
- **Economic Support**: Providing family livelihood alternatives
- **Community Monitoring**: Local systems to identify and prevent child labour

### Rescue and Rehabilitation

- **Identification Networks**: Community-based reporting systems
- **Safe Rescue Operations**: Coordinated with authorities
- **Educational Rehabilitation**: Enrolling rescued children in schools
- **Skill Development**: Preparing children for future employment

### Alternative Opportunities

- **Scholarship Programs**: Financial incentives for education

## Implementation in Rural Bihar

Adapting to local contexts:

- **Village-Level Interventions**: Localized prevention and support

## Measuring Prevention Impact

We evaluate through:

## Success Stories

In a high child labour area, our program reduced incidence by 80% through education access and family support.

### Individual Rehabilitation

A rescued child completed education and secured skilled employment, breaking the poverty cycle.

## Challenges in Child Labour Prevention

Rural Bihar faces specific obstacles:

- **Economic Pressures**: Poverty driving families to child labour
