# Child Welfare in India: Naaz Commercial Institute's Holistic Approach

Child welfare encompasses the protection, care, and development of children, ensuring their rights and well-being. In rural Bihar, where vulnerabilities are heightened by poverty and limited resources, comprehensive child welfare programs are essential. Naaz Commercial Institute, established in 1990, has pioneered integrated child welfare initiatives that address education, health, protection, and development needs.

## Understanding Child Welfare in the Indian Context

Child welfare in India involves safeguarding children's rights while promoting their holistic development. This includes protection from abuse, access to education, healthcare, and opportunities for growth.
