## International Perspectives

In the US, NGOs like Teach for America recruit teachers [TeachforAmerica.org](https://www.teachforamerica.org/). In Kenya, BRAC provides affordable education [BRAC.org](https://www.brac.net/). India can learn from their scalability.

## Future Challenges and Opportunities

Challenges: Digital divide, climate change impacts.

Opportunities: AI in education, partnerships with tech companies.

Naaz plans to integrate digital tools for wider reach.

## Detailed Challenges

### Funding Shortages

NGOs rely on donations, grants, and CSR, but economic downturns reduce contributions. For example, during COVID-19, funding dropped by 30% for many organizations [NGO Reports](https://ngodarpan.gov.in/).

### Infrastructure Issues

Rural areas lack electricity, internet, and buildings. NGOs like Naaz build temporary schools, but sustainability is a challenge.

### Teacher Shortages

Qualified teachers prefer urban jobs. NGOs train local volunteers, but retention is low due to low pay.

### Cultural Barriers

In Bihar, caste and gender norms prevent girls from attending school. NGOs conduct awareness campaigns to change mindsets.

## More Success Stories

## Funding Mechanisms

- **Corporate Partnerships**: CSR funds from companies like Tata and Reliance.

- **Government Grants**: Under schemes like SSA.

- **International Aid**: From UNICEF and World Bank.

Naaz Commercial Institute raised ₹2 crore in 2023 through these sources.

## International Perspectives

In developing countries, NGOs are crucial. In Bangladesh, BRAC educates 1.5 million children [BRAC.org](https://www.brac.net/). In India, NGOs complement government efforts, as seen in NEP 2020's emphasis on public-private partnerships.

## Future Trends

- **Digital Education**: Online platforms for remote learning.

- **Skill-Based Curriculum**: Focus on employability.

- **Inclusive Education**: For disabled and marginalized groups.

- **Sustainability Goals**: Aligning with SDG 4.
