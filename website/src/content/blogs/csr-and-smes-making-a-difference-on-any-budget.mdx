## Introduction

CSR is not limited to large corporations. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can deliver meaningful social impact through targeted, locally relevant initiatives that align with their scale and capabilities.

## Practical CSR Approaches for SMEs

SMEs can contribute through:

- Local education sponsorships
- In-kind contributions
- Employee volunteering
- Skill-based support

These approaches require modest budgets but offer tangible outcomes.

## Measuring Local Impact

Simple indicators—such as beneficiaries reached or hours contributed—are sufficient for credible reporting.

## Building Long-Term Value

Consistent CSR engagement strengthens community relationships and builds local brand trust.

## Conclusion

CSR is scalable. SMEs that engage thoughtfully can create lasting social value while strengthening their business foundations.
