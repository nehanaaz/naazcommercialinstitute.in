# Child Rights Violations: Causes, Impacts, and Prevention Strategies

Child rights violations represent a grave threat to children's well-being and India's future development. Naaz Commercial Institute actively works to prevent violations, protect vulnerable children, and advocate for stronger enforcement in rural Bihar.

## Understanding Child Rights Violations

Child rights violations occur when children's fundamental entitlements are denied or infringed upon, causing harm to their physical, emotional, and developmental well-being.

### Types of Violations

- **Physical Abuse**: Corporal punishment and violent discipline
- **Sexual Abuse**: Exploitation and molestation
- **Emotional Abuse**: Psychological harm and neglect
- **Neglect**: Failure to provide basic needs
- **Exploitation**: Child labor and trafficking
- **Discrimination**: Denial of rights based on gender, caste, or disability

## Legal Framework Against Violations

India's legal system provides comprehensive protections.

### Juvenile Justice Act, 2015

Addresses violations through:

- Protection of children in need of care and protection
- Rehabilitation and reintegration programs
- Special juvenile police units
- Child welfare committees

### POCSO Act, 2012

Combats sexual violations:

- Defines and penalizes sexual offenses against children
