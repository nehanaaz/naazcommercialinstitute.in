# Fundamental Rights of Children: Advocacy and Implementation in Rural Bihar

The fundamental rights of children form the foundation of their protection, development, and participation in society. At Naaz Commercial Institute, we educate, advocate, and implement children's rights in rural Bihar, ensuring that every child enjoys their entitlements under Indian law and international conventions.

## Understanding Children's Fundamental Rights

Children's rights encompass civil, political, economic, social, and cultural entitlements specifically designed to protect and nurture young people. These rights recognize children as individuals with agency and dignity.

### Core Categories of Rights

## Legal Framework for Children's Rights

India's legal system comprehensively addresses children's rights.

Article 15(3) allows special provisions for children, while Article 21A guarantees the right to education. Article 39(f) mandates protection from abuse and exploitation.
