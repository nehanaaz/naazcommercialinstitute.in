# Helping Poor Children: Naaz Commercial Institute's Comprehensive Support

Helping poor children requires addressing their immediate needs while building pathways to long-term prosperity. At Naaz Commercial Institute, we provide holistic support to impoverished children in rural Bihar, combining education, health, nutrition, and economic empowerment to break the cycle of poverty.

## Understanding Poverty's Impact on Children

Poverty affects every aspect of a child's life, from physical health to educational opportunities and emotional well-being. In rural Bihar, children from poor families often lack access to basic services, face discrimination, and have limited pathways to break free from cycles of disadvantage.

### Consequences of Child Poverty

- **Health Issues**: Malnutrition, disease susceptibility, stunted growth
- **Educational Barriers**: Lack of school supplies, transportation, and support
- **Emotional Stress**: Anxiety, low self-esteem, behavioral challenges
- **Future Limitations**: Reduced employment opportunities and economic mobility

## Legal Protections for Poor Children

India's legal framework provides safeguards for disadvantaged children.

### Right to Education Act, 2009

RTE mandates:

- Free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14
- Special provisions for children from disadvantaged groups
- Prohibition of discrimination and capitation fees

### Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)

ICDS supports poor children through:

- Supplementary nutrition programs
- Health check-ups and immunization
- Early learning and preschool education

### National Food Security Act, 2013

This act ensures:

- Access to subsidized food grains for poor families
