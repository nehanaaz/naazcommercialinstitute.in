# Child Trafficking in India: Causes, Impacts, and NGO Interventions

Child trafficking represents one of the most severe violations of children's rights, destroying lives and perpetuating cycles of exploitation. Naaz Commercial Institute actively combats trafficking through prevention, rescue, and rehabilitation programs in rural Bihar.

## Understanding Child Trafficking

Child trafficking involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of children for exploitation purposes, using force, coercion, or deception.

### Forms of Child Trafficking

- **Organ Removal**: Illegal organ harvesting
- **Forced Marriage**: Child marriage and servitude
- **Illegal Adoption**: Sale of children for adoption
- **Child Soldiers**: Recruitment into armed groups

## Legal Framework Against Trafficking

India has comprehensive anti-trafficking laws.

### Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956

Criminalizes trafficking for sexual exploitation:

- Prohibits brothels and trafficking
- Provides for rehabilitation of victims
- Establishes protective homes
- Penalizes clients and traffickers

### Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018

Comprehensive legislation addressing all forms of trafficking:

- Defines trafficking broadly

## Causes of Child Trafficking

Understanding root causes is essential for prevention.

### Demand-Side Factors
