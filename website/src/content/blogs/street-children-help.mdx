# Street Children Help: Rehabilitation and Empowerment in Rural Bihar

Street children represent one of the most vulnerable groups in society, facing exploitation, abuse, and lack of basic rights. In rural Bihar, where economic pressures drive children to urban areas or local streets, Naaz Commercial Institute provides comprehensive help through rehabilitation, education, and family reintegration programs.

## Understanding Street Children in Rural Contexts

Street children in rural Bihar often come from impoverished families, migrating to towns for work or begging. They face risks of abuse, exploitation, child labor, and lack of education, perpetuating cycles of poverty.

### Characteristics and Challenges

- **Family Displacement**: Children separated from families due to poverty or conflict
- **Economic Exploitation**: Forced into labor or begging
- **Health Risks**: Exposure to disease, malnutrition, and substance abuse
- **Educational Exclusion**: Lack of access to schooling and learning opportunities
- **Legal Vulnerabilities**: Limited protection and rights enforcement

## Legal Framework for Street Children

India provides legal protections for street children.

### Juvenile Justice Act, 2015

This act addresses:

- Children in need of care and protection
- Rehabilitation and reintegration procedures
- Establishment of child welfare committees
- Prohibition of institutionalization for petty offenses

### Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), 2012

POCSO protects street children from:

- Sexual abuse and exploitation
- Mandatory reporting requirements
- Child-friendly legal procedures
- Rehabilitation support for victims

### Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016

This act addresses economic abuse by:

- Prohibiting employment of children under 14
- Regulating work for adolescents (14-18)
- Providing rehabilitation for child laborers
- Imposing penalties on violators
