## Deduction Limits and Rates

The deduction under Section 80G varies based on the type of organization and the nature of the donation.

### Standard Deduction Rates

### Calculation of Deduction

The deduction is calculated as:

Deduction = (Donation amount × Deduction rate) subject to qualifying limit

For example, if an individual with adjusted gross total income of ₹10,00,000 donates ₹1,00,000 to an 80G approved NGO, the deduction would be ₹50,000 (50% of ₹1,00,000), subject to the 10% limit of ₹1,00,000.
