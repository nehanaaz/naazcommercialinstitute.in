This article explores the various aspects of NGO volunteering in India, its impacts, benefits, and how you can get started.

Additionally, platforms like [Volunteer India](https://www.volunteerindia.org/) report that volunteers contribute thousands of hours to causes ranging from education to environmental conservation. In 2023, volunteers helped in disaster relief efforts, reaching over 5 million affected people. These statistics highlight the scale and importance of volunteering in India's development landscape.
